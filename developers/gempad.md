Thanks to our partnership with [Gempad.app](https://gempad.app) Launchpad you are now able to utilize their easy to use platform to launch your project on ChewySwap either using a no-code pre-audited token deployer or by using various funding methods such as Presale, Fair Launch, Hyper Sale and Special Sale.



## Token Deployer

Instructions to use Gempad's token deployer to launch your token on ChewySwap exchange. If you have any problems contact [Morty ](https://t.me/MortyGainz)from Gempad or check [Gempad's Official Guides](https://gempad.gitbook.io/the-gempad/token-creator/how-to-and-information)

1. Go to [Gempad.app](https://gempad.app) and Connect your wallet using Shibarium Network
2. Click the Green "Create" button at the top right of the screen and select "Token" from the list
3. Select your Token Type from the following options:
   * Simple Token (No tax, no frills)
   * Standard Token (Allows setting Marketing and Liquidity Tax)
   * Reflection Token (Reflect a % in native tokens to holders, Safemoon Style)&#x20;
   * Dividend Token (Allows to reward holders in any ERC20 token)
   * Ultimate Token (Split up fees to Marketing, Treasury and Burn)
4. Enter the token's information including:
   * Name, Symbol (Short name), Total Supply, Decimals (That's it on a Simple Token)
   * Max Wallet, Max Transaction Amount (the most anyone can hold in one wallet or buy or sell at once)
   * Select "**ChewySwap**" from the Router Dropdown
   * Select BONE as Base token (will be official WBONE address: 0xC76F4c819D820369Fb2d7C1531aB3Bb18e6fE8d8)
   * Set your Marketing Wallet (wallet which will be sent marketing funds) and check off whether you want to receive your marketing fee in BONE instead of tokens (recommended)
   * Set all applicable Fee Percents on Buys and Sells
   * For Dividend Tokens:
     * Select which token you want your marketing fee in from the Dropdown: it can be the token itself, the Base token (WBONE) or the Dividend Token
     * Set Reflection Token Contract Address (must be an ERC20 token that also has liquidity on ChewySwap
     * Set Minimum token balance for dividends distribution (Holder must have at least this amount to receive rewards)
   * If you want to Implement Anti-Bot check it off ([Check Here to learn what this does and the steps](https://gempad.gitbook.io/the-gempad/token-creator/antibot-management-guide))
5. Once everything is filled out and there are no Red items, click Create Token to continue. Gempad charges a fee of 100 BONE for a pre-audited token contract
6. You will receive your token's total supply in your wallet after the transaction is confirmed. To launch your token go to the [ChewySwap Liquidity Tab](https://chewyswap.dog/#/pool)&#x20;
7. Click Add Liquidity, import your contract address in one currency box and select BONE in the other
8. Enter the amount of BONE you'd like to add to the pool and the amount of your token (Usually do max or if you want to save a distribution for marketing/team do the total supply minus the # of tokens to save
9.  Approve Both Tokens, after Approve TX confirms click Confirm Supply to add Liquidity and you now have a tradable token on ChewySwap!



## Presales, Hyper Launch, Fair Launch

You can also raise funds in a presale on [Gempad ](https://gempad.app)to launch your project on [ChewySwap](https://chewyswap.dog). In a presale a % of funds raised can go to the team which can be helpful if you are planning to build a utility or heavily market post-launch. There are different price tiers when doing a presale. ChewySwap is whitelisted on Gempad and when you Finalize your presale liquidity is automatically added and locked at the conclusion of the sale. For more information [read their docs](https://gempad.gitbook.io/the-gempad/guide-for-project-owners/create-a-sale-at-gempad).
