# üõ†Ô∏è Build on ChewySwap

## Introduction

ChewySwap supports both Shibarium and Dogechain, our two favorite Doggo-Based Layer 2 EVM compatible blockchains! Even though Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are rival meme coins, we love and support each equally just as a pet owner loves each of their doggies equally. We only want the best for our pets so lets get to the nitty gritty on how to build for each of these blockchains!
