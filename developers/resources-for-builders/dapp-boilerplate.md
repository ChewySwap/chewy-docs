# Dapp Boilerplate

## Prerequisites

This boilerplate and guide assumes some background experience in programming languages and the inner workings of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is not a step by step guide for someone starting from zero experience, so in this document we won't go into the basics of "How to install VSCode" or "How to code". We live in the information age where knowledge is freely available right at your fingertips. If you have the drive and ability to search for topics on Google then you have everything you need to learn these skills. In other words, you can lead a doggo to a water bowl but you can't make them drink!&#x20;

These are prerequisite knowledge/skills needed to build your first Dapp on Dogechain or Shibarium with some recommended resources:

* **Some background in Typescript, which is strongly typed Javascript**. If you're completely new to programming languages I would start with learning Javascript and then learning the differences ad advantages of using Typescript over Javascript. There are multitudes of resources online for this such as:
  * [W3Schools Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
  * [W3Schools Typescript](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php)
  * or if you learn better with videos:
    * [JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners: Learn JavaScript in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)
    * [How to learn Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quJzdnXuNDc)
* HTML and JSX
* Knowledge of [React](https://react.dev/) / React Frameworks such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Knowledge
  * [Mastering Ethereum ](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file)can be read for free in their GitHub repository
* Visual Studio Code Installed
* NodeJS Installed (Recommend using a version manager such as NVM to easily switch between versions, recommend using NodeJS 18+)
  * [Install NVM on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
  * [NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)



## Using ChewySwap's Boilerplate

The Shib Dapp Boilerplate is meant as a starting point for developers to create their own apps on Shibarium and/or Dogechain. It includes the most up to date libraries and frameworks including NextJS 15 RC, React 19, WAGMI/Viem, Walletconnect's AppKit for wallet connection with Tailwinds for easy styling. It will be periodically updated and we'll possibly release versions for different wallet connection kits such as RainbowKit, ConnectKit, etc.

{% hint style="danger" %}
More information will be added here soon as the boilerplate is still in active development as we add more examples of how to interact with the blockchain. The GitHub repository can be found at [https://github.com/ChewySwap/shib-dapp-boilerplate](https://github.com/ChewySwap/shib-dapp-boilerplate)
