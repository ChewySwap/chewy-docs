{% hint style="warning" %}
This page will soon be deprecated as our token and NFT launchpad is currently under construction and coming soon! If you have a project you'd like to launch on ChewySwap or migrate from another DEX feel free to [reach out to us for more details](https://t.me/m/vQs2JNEBNzkx) or ask in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/chewyswapcommunity)!
{% endhint %}

If you're looking to launch your own token project on ChewySwap there are many resources available for developers unique to our DEX! If you have any questions also feel welcome to ask in our [Official Telegram Group](https://t.me/chewyswapcommunity) and our experienced community of developers would be happy to assist you with your smart contract, Dapp, NFT and more!\
\
To make it easy for users to create their own tokens we've made a FREE no-code token deployer tool located at [Token.Chewy.Build](https://token.chewy.build). This tool will create a basic ERC-20 token contract with 0 tax, all you do is:\


1. Enter Token Name
2. Enter Token Symbol
3. Enter Token Decimals (or leave at 18, recommended)
4. Enter Total Supply
5. Click Submit, Confirm the Transaction in your wallet
6. Once the transaction is confirmed the token's contract address will appear underneath
7. Click the "Add Liquidity on ChewySwap" link to go to ChewySwap to pair Liquidity.
8. Enter an appropriate amount of starting BONE and the amount of tokens you want to add
9. Approve your token, then click Supply. Once the transaction is confirmed your token is n ow tradable on [ChewySwap](https://chewyswap.dog)!

To provide your own contract to compile and deploy using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) check the [Smart Contracts](smart-contracts/) page for our Router address (needed if your token contract has a tax or rewards).



\*\* Alternatively, you can launch your project on ChewySwap using the tools provided by our partners at [Gempad Legacy Launchpad](https://legacy.gempad.app/create-token). Check the next page for more information
