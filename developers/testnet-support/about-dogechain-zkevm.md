* Dogechain PoS serves as a L2 solution to Dogecoin PoW and it has provided abundant usage scenarios for more than 300M DOGE and their holders. However, centralized bridges, albeit vital to bringing liquidity to the chain, have proven to be vulnerable and exert a high risk to users. Dogechain zkEVM will benefit from trustless asset bridging using rollups, from Ethereum and the numerous chains utilizing Polygon CDK. In this regard, it will remove the dependence on third-party bridges, increase security and provide higher interoperability with other blockchains.
* Dogechain zkEVM will connect to a wider Layer 2 Dapp ecosystem & liquidity with zkEVM technology while remaining to be powered by Dogecoin, where DOGE is used as gas.
* Sets a platform for a growing ecosystem for EVM-native ZK applications and enhances utility for Dogecoin by providing it with industry-leading EVM-equivalent smart contracts. As the zkEVM inevitably grows, so will the opportunities for Dogechain users of trustlessly access and utilize liquidity from these blockchains.
* Rolls up transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, enforcing immutability and benefitting from its high security and decentralization.
