## Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens on Shibarium & Dogechain in a Decentralized way: No registration or account needed.

### By the People, For the People!

ChewySwap is the leading _**Community-Based**_ decentralized exchange on Shibarium and Dogechain, the two leading EVM compatible blockchains for Dog lovers!

### Low, Near-Zero Fees!

If you thought BSC had low fees wait til you start trading on Shibarium! The cost for a swap on ChewySwap is fractions of a Bone making trading an easy and fast process. Even when BONE goes to hundreds of dollars those fees will still only be pennies which is much lower than BSC and _**miles**_ lower than Ethereum!

## &#x20;Earn

> Earn DOGECORN and other tokens for free with interest rates even bigger than Shrek himself!

### Earn tokens with Single Staking (Coming Soon)

Stake a variety of Shibarium-based tokens and earn free tokens. Third party pools provided to projects feed back into our ecosystem making for more sustainable rewards helping Chewy retain its value so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn CHEWY with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn CHEWY. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with single token staking pools, but you can earn higher APR to offset the risk

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem! Even if your trading pair isn't supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).
