\
_\*\* There are a limited number of spots open currently in the ChewySwap Ambassador program and we'll be increasing the number of Ambassadors steadily over time, if you'd like to increase your chances to get picked then your best bet is to take part in our_ [_Telegram Community_](https://t.me/ChewySwapCommunity) _and show a good example of what we're looking for in an Ambassador - post about Chewy on social media, be helpful with new users and be passionate about crypto! Do not dm admins begging to be hired as an Ambassador, lead by example and you'll be noticed!_\
\
_\*\*\* There is no guarantee that any knowledge you learn herein will help you to earn money, this all depends on what you take out of the program and how much you choose to participate and learn from all the different people and projects that you'll be networking with. This is never financial advice and always do your own research on any projects that the Ambassador program helps to promote. There is no guarantee of safety in crypto, the best we can do is educate ourselves and we aim to help educate our users and ambassadors above all! What you get out of the ambassador program is proportional to what you put in and we hope to see you there!_
