# üí± DEX Aggregator

## Introduction to DEX Aggregators

Decentralized Exchange (DEX) **aggregators** are like the travel search engines of crypto trading ‚Äì but instead of flights, they hunt for the best token swap deals across multiple exchanges. In simple terms, a DEX aggregator is a tool that **searches many decentralized exchanges at once** to find users the most favorable price for a trade. This means traders **don‚Äôt have to manually check each DEX** for rates; the aggregator does the comparison shopping automatically. By combining liquidity from various exchanges into one platform, an aggregator can often **offer better prices and lower slippage** (price changes during a trade) than any single exchange could on its own. The result? Users get more value from their swaps, **save time**, and avoid the pitfalls of bad trades on illiquid markets or with high slippage.

### **Benefits of using a DEX aggregator:**

* **Best Prices:** The aggregator scours multiple DEXs to ensure the trade executes at the best available rate. It can even split a single trade across several exchanges if that yields more tokens for the user.
* **Time Saving:** Instead of visiting several DEX platforms and comparing rates manually, users trade in one place. The aggregator‚Äôs smart contract does the heavy lifting behind the scenes to find the optimal path.
* **Avoiding Bad Trades:** Low liquidity on a single DEX can cause **high slippage**, meaning a user might get much fewer tokens than expected. An aggregator can detect this and reroute the trade through better pools or multiple hops, preventing nasty surprises. In short, it helps users **avoid trades with poor liquidity or huge price impact**.

All of this happens seamlessly. From a user‚Äôs perspective, they just enter the trade they want, and the aggregator‚Äôs **‚Äúcrypto ninja‚Äù code** finds the best way to execute it. It‚Äôs a bit like having a **loyal canine sidekick sniff out** the best bargains in the crypto marketplace ‚Äì **ChewySwap‚Äôs aggregator** does exactly that on Shibarium and Dogechain, the blockchains in the dog-loving crypto realm.

### How to Use the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator

Using the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator is straightforward and beginner-friendly. The interface is designed to walk users through a token swap step by step in a single screen. Here‚Äôs how a user can swap tokens on ChewySwap:

1. **Select the Tokens to Swap:** On the aggregator page, there are two main fields ‚Äì the **‚ÄúSell‚Äù box and the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù box**. In the Sell box, the user taps the token name (on the right side of the field) to choose which token they want to swap _out_. For example, if the user has Token A and wants to trade it, they would select Token A in the Sell box. In the Buy box, the user similarly taps the token name to select the token they want to receive (Token B, for instance). The interface provides a searchable list of tokens for convenience, so users can easily find the token by symbol or name.
2. **Enter the Amount to Swap:** Once the tokens are selected, the user enters the amount of the Sell token they want to swap. As soon as they type in an amount, ChewySwap will display the **estimated USD value** of that amount directly below or within the Sell box. This real-time market data helps users instantly gauge how much their input is worth in dollars, giving context especially for those more familiar with fiat values. For instance, if a user enters 100 Token A and it shows \~$50 USD, they understand the scale of their trade.
3. **Review the Expected Output:** After entering the sell amount, the Buy box will show how much of the desired token the user is expected to receive. This includes the **amount of the Buy token** and also an estimated USD value for that output. For example, it might display that 100 Token A could yield 250 Token B (‚âà$49 USD). This side-by-side display of input vs output values lets users quickly compare the two.
4. **Check Price Impact & Split Large Trades if Needed:** It‚Äôs important for users to **compare the USD value of what they‚Äôre putting in versus what they‚Äôre getting out**. In a perfect liquid market, $50 in might equal about $50 out (minus small fees). If the USD values are wildly different ‚Äì say $50 in but only $40 out ‚Äì that indicates a **large price impact or low liquidity** for that trade. ChewySwap will usually also warn of a high price impact if that‚Äôs the case. In such situations, it might be a good idea to **split the trade into smaller chunks**. By doing multiple smaller swaps, users can sometimes get a better overall rate with less slippage, especially on volatile or low-liquidity tokens. In short, **if the numbers look ‚Äúoff,‚Äù pause and adjust** before hitting swap.
5. **Token Approval (if Required):** When the user is trading a token that is **not the native coin of the chain**, an extra step is needed the first time. For example, on Shibarium, BONE is the native token used for gas, whereas an ERC-20 token like LEASH would require approval. ChewySwap will automatically detect if an approval is required. Users will see a button (usually ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù) instead of the final ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù at first. **Approving** lets the smart contract move the specified token on the user‚Äôs behalf. This is a one-time on-chain transaction per token, per app, and incurs a small gas fee. After tapping approve and confirming that transaction in their wallet, the user can then proceed to execute the swap in the second step. _(In summary, some swaps are a 2-step process: first approve the token, then execute the swap. Native tokens like BONE or DOGE don‚Äôt need approval.)_
6. **Review the Swap Path:** Just below the Swap button, the ChewySwap interface shows a **swap path (route)** for the trade. This is a small but super-useful detail provided by the aggregator. It typically displays a series of token icons or symbols connected by arrows, along with the names of the DEXs involved in each step. For example, it might show something like Token A ‚Üí Token X ‚Üí Token B, with labels of which DEX each leg of the trade uses. This means the aggregator found it best to swap Token A to Token X on, say, Uniswap, then Token X to Token B on ChewySwap‚Äôs own pools (just as an example). By looking at this route preview, users can understand **how the trade will be executed behind the scenes**. It‚Äôs transparent ‚Äì if ChewySwap is going through multiple hops or other exchanges to get the best deal, the user sees that route clearly. For curious users, it‚Äôs almost like watching your **crypto trade GPS** find the optimal path. If the path seems too convoluted or includes an unfamiliar token as an intermediary, that‚Äôs usually nothing to worry about (the contract will handle it atomically); it‚Äôs just the aggregator being efficient.
7. **Be Aware of the Fees (and Discounts):** ChewySwap‚Äôs aggregator applies a **0.15% swap fee** on trades. This fee is taken from the output token, similar to how many DEXs have a small fee per swap. However, there‚Äôs a special **discount program** for ChewySwap‚Äôs community: users who hold **6900 CHEWY tokens or more** (ChewySwap‚Äôs own token) get **the 0.15% fee waived entirely**. In other words, loyal Chewy holders at that threshold trade fee-free on the aggregator. Even holding fewer CHEWY tokens grants a partial discount ‚Äì it scales with the amount of CHEWY held. For example, holding **3450 CHEWY (which is 50% of 6900)** would grant a 50% fee reduction, so the user would pay only a 0.075% fee instead of 0.15%. This encourages community members to hold CHEWY for perks, and it gives a nice benefit to those already invested in the ecosystem. The interface will usually indicate if a fee is being applied or if it‚Äôs waived, so users can know if their trade will incur the aggregator fee. _(Note: This aggregator fee is separate from the usual ‚Äúliquidity provider‚Äù fees that come from the DEX pools themselves ‚Äì those are typically built into the quoted price. The 0.15% is ChewySwap‚Äôs platform fee.)_
8. **Execute the Swap:** After reviewing all the above ‚Äì the tokens, amounts, USD estimates, price impact, route, and fee ‚Äì the user is ready to **swap**. Hitting the **Swap button** will prompt a confirmation showing a summary (usually the minimum amount out, the route, and the fee, plus gas cost). The user confirms the transaction in their wallet (e.g., MetaMask or WalletConnect popup). The ChewySwap aggregator‚Äôs smart contract will then carry out the trade across the necessary DEX(s) as shown in the route. In a few moments, the user will have the new tokens in their wallet. **Voil√†!** The aggregator has seamlessly gotten them the best deal available.

Throughout this process, ChewySwap keeps the tone light and the UI intuitive ‚Äì even a first-timer can follow along. Tips or warnings (like high slippage alerts) are presented in plain language. It‚Äôs almost as if the app is a friendly guide, not just a tool. **Beginner users** don‚Äôt need to know the complex algorithms at work; they can trust that ChewySwap‚Äôs DEX aggregator is working in their favor, much like a _helpful pupper fetching the stick you threw ‚Äì but here the ‚Äústick‚Äù is the best price for your crypto trade!_ üêï

### Sending Tokens

ChewySwap isn‚Äôt just about swapping tokens; it also provides a simple way to **send tokens** to another address or username, right from the same interface. This is handy for transferring tokens to a friend or moving assets between your own wallets without leaving ChewySwap.

&#x20;_Illustration: The **Send** tab on ChewySwap‚Äôs interface. In this example, a user is sending 100 BONE (‚âà$25.48) to the Shib name `chewydoggo.shib`, which the app resolves to a standard address (0x371f...BAA0). The ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button will initiate the transfer after confirmation._

To send tokens using ChewySwap:

* **Navigate to the Send Tab:** At the top of the exchange interface, users can switch from **Swap** to **Send**. The Send tab is dedicated to one thing ‚Äì helping users transfer tokens to another wallet easily. It has a very straightforward layout with fields to fill out the details of the transfer.
* **Select the Token and Amount:** The first field lets the user choose which token to send. Just like in the swap interface, tapping the token name opens the list of available tokens. The user picks the token they want to transfer (e.g., BONE, CHEWY, or any supported token in their wallet). Next, they enter the **amount** of that token to send. An estimate of the USD value may be shown here as well (giving a sense of how much value is being transferred). For example, the user might select BONE and enter ‚Äú100‚Äù as the amount, seeing ‚Äú$25.48‚Äù as an approximate value below it, as shown in the screenshot above.
* **Enter the Recipient‚Äôs Address or .SHIB Name:** ChewySwap supports the Shibarium Name Service (addresses that end in `.shib`), making it **easier to send to human-readable names**. In the recipient field, users can either paste the long wallet address (a 0x... Ethereum-like address) or simply type a **.shib name** if the recipient has one. For instance, instead of `0x371f...BAA0`, one could just enter `chewydoggo.shib` ‚Äì which is much easier to remember. The ChewySwap interface will automatically **resolve the .shib name to the correct address** (and usually display the shortened address as confirmation, like showing 0x371f...BAA0 once resolved). This way, users can be confident they got the name right and it points to the intended wallet. This feature helps avoid the common error of copying a wrong address or sending to the wrong person, as long as the .shib name is correct.
* **Send and Confirm:** Once the token, amount, and recipient are filled in, the user clicks the **Send button**. A confirmation prompt will appear, similar to sending a transaction from a wallet. The user should **double-check** two critical things: the **amount** (is it 100 BONE or the intended amount?) and the **recipient** (is the address or name exactly correct?). Crypto transactions are **irreversible** ‚Äì if you send to the wrong address, there‚Äôs no getting it back. ChewySwap‚Äôs UI provides that final confirmation step for safety. After verifying everything, the user confirms the transaction in their wallet. The transfer will then be broadcast to the network. In a moment, the recipient address will receive the tokens. There is **no special fee** charged by ChewySwap for sending tokens; unlike swaps, the aggregator doesn‚Äôt take a cut for simple transfers. The user only pays the normal blockchain **network gas fee** for the transaction (since moving tokens on-chain always costs a bit of gas).

Sending tokens via ChewySwap is as friendly as sending a photo via chat ‚Äì the interface doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the user with technicalities. It even incorporates the meme-friendly Shib naming system to make the experience less ‚Äúcrypto geek‚Äù and more **approachable for everyone**. Whether sending a few tokens to a friend (perhaps repaying a lunch in BONE tokens for fun!), or moving assets around, the Send feature streamlines the process with a **clean, simple form** and helpful name resolution. Just remember: always check twice before hitting send, just like making sure you‚Äôre texting the right person ‚Äì because in crypto, there‚Äôs no undo button!

### Market Ticker

The ChewySwap DEX aggregator page isn‚Äôt just a swap tool ‚Äì it also keeps users informed with a handy **market ticker** running along the interface. This ticker is essentially a scrolling (or updating) list of select token prices and their 24-hour change, giving a quick pulse of the market at a glance. It often displays popular tokens (like major Shibarium ecosystem coins and other trending assets) with their current price in USD (or the chain‚Äôs native token) and a small indicator of how much the price has moved in the last day (e.g., +5% or -3%). The presentation might use color cues ‚Äì green for price up, red for price down ‚Äì to make it easy to scan.

What‚Äôs neat about the ticker is that it‚Äôs **interactive**. If a user **clicks on a token** shown in the ticker, ChewySwap will open a **popup window or modal** with more detailed information. In that token detail popup, users can typically find:

* **Market Statistics:** Key data like the token‚Äôs current price, 24h high and low, trading volume, market capitalization (if available), and other useful stats.
* **Price Chart:** Often a small chart (perhaps powered by an integration like DexScreener or TradingView) that shows the token‚Äôs price over a timeframe (like the past day or week). This helps users see trends (did the price spike recently? is it relatively stable?).
* **Project Links:** ChewySwap makes it convenient to get more information about the token by providing direct links. These can include the **official website of the project**, and social media or community links like **Twitter/X, Telegram, or Discord**, and possibly a link to the token‚Äôs page on a block explorer or CoinGecko. This way, users can DYOR (do your own research) if a token catches their eye ‚Äì all without leaving the ChewySwap page.
* **Quick Actions:** In some cases, the popup might also offer a shortcut to trade that token (like a ‚ÄúTrade‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù button taking the user back to the swap interface with that token pre-selected), or to add the token to their wallet.

The market ticker feature turns the aggregator page into a mini dashboard for crypto market watching. New users will appreciate that they can monitor prices of top tokens in real-time while deciding on a swap. For example, a user might notice on the ticker that Token X is up 20% today ‚Äì maybe prompting them to click it and learn more, or swap into it if they feel confident. It‚Äôs a bit of **meme culture meets practicality**: imagine a user seeing DOGE or SHIB coin zooming on the ticker ‚Äì the interface almost winks and says ‚Äúhey, look at this pup coin running today!‚Äù but in a very factual, data-driven way.

Overall, the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator page is **friendly and welcoming to new crypto users**. It provides powerful tools (like multi-DEX trading and name service transfers) in a simplified package. The tone of the platform (and this documentation) is lighthearted ‚Äì you might even catch a dog meme reference or two ‚Äì because crypto is meant to be fun as well as empowering. ChewySwap wants users to feel comfortable, whether they‚Äôre **seasoned traders sniffing out arbitrage** or **complete beginners taking their first steps** into decentralized finance. With its easy interface, helpful visuals, and a dash of humor, the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator is like a loyal pup by the user‚Äôs side in the vast dog park of DeFi, making the adventure easier and more enjoyable. Happy swapping, and may your trades always find the best route (with maybe a few treats along the way)! üêïüöÄ
