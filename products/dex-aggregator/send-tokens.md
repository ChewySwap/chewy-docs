# Send Tokens

## How to Send Tokens

ChewySwap isn’t just about swapping tokens; it also provides a simple way to **send tokens** to another address or username, right from the same interface. This is handy for transferring tokens to a friend or moving assets between your own wallets without leaving ChewySwap.

In this example, a user is sending 100 BONE (≈$25.48) to the Shib name <code>chewydoggo.shib</code>, which the app resolves to a standard address (0x371f...BAA0). The “Send” button will initiate the transfer after confirmation.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### To send tokens using ChewySwap:

* **Navigate to the Send Tab:** At the top of the exchange interface, users can switch from **Swap** to **Send**. The Send tab is dedicated to one thing – helping users transfer tokens to another wallet easily. It has a very straightforward layout with fields to fill out the details of the transfer.
* **Select the Token and Amount:** The first field lets the user choose which token to send. Just like in the swap interface, tapping the token name opens the list of available tokens. The user picks the token they want to transfer (e.g., BONE, CHEWY, or any supported token in their wallet). Next, they enter the **amount** of that token to send. An estimate of the USD value may be shown here as well (giving a sense of how much value is being transferred). For example, the user might select BONE and enter “100” as the amount, seeing “$25.48” as an approximate value below it, as shown in the screenshot above.
* **Enter the Recipient’s Address or .SHIB Name:** ChewySwap supports the Shibarium Name Service (addresses that end in `.shib`), making it **easier to send to human-readable names**. In the recipient field, users can either paste the long wallet address (a 0x... Ethereum-like address) or simply type a **.shib name** if the recipient has one. For instance, instead of `0x371f...BAA0`, one could just enter `chewydoggo.shib` – which is much easier to remember. The ChewySwap interface will automatically **resolve the .shib name to the correct address** (and usually display the shortened address as confirmation, like showing 0x371f...BAA0 once resolved). This way, users can be confident they got the name right and it points to the intended wallet. This feature helps avoid the common error of copying a wrong address or sending to the wrong person, as long as the .shib name is correct.
* **Send and Confirm:** Once the token, amount, and recipient are filled in, the user clicks the **Send button**. A confirmation prompt will appear, similar to sending a transaction from a wallet. The user should **double-check** two critical things: the **amount** (is it 100 BONE or the intended amount?) and the **recipient** (is the address or name exactly correct?). Crypto transactions are **irreversible** – if you send to the wrong address, there’s no getting it back. ChewySwap’s UI provides that final confirmation step for safety. After verifying everything, the user confirms the transaction in their wallet. The transfer will then be broadcast to the network. In a moment, the recipient address will receive the tokens. There is **no special fee** charged by ChewySwap for sending tokens; unlike swaps, the aggregator doesn’t take a cut for simple transfers. The user only pays the normal blockchain **network gas fee** for the transaction (since moving tokens on-chain always costs a bit of gas).

Sending tokens via ChewySwap is as friendly as sending a photo via chat – the interface doesn’t overwhelm the user with technicalities. It even incorporates the meme-friendly Shib naming system to make the experience less “crypto geek” and more **approachable for everyone**. Whether sending a few tokens to a friend (perhaps repaying a lunch in TREAT tokens for fun!), or moving assets around, the Send feature streamlines the process with a **clean, simple form** and helpful name resolution. Just remember: always check twice before hitting send, just like making sure you’re texting the right person – because in crypto, there’s no undo button!
