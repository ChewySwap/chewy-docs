# Send Tokens

## How to Send Tokens

ChewySwap isn’t just about swapping tokens; it also provides a simple way to **send tokens** to another address or username, right from the same interface. This is handy for transferring tokens to a friend or moving assets between your own wallets without leaving ChewySwap.

&#x20;_Illustration: The **Send** tab on ChewySwap’s interface. In this example, a user is sending 100 BONE (≈$25.48) to the Shib name `chewydoggo.shib`, which the app resolves to a standard address (0x371f...BAA0). The “Send” button will initiate the transfer after confirmation._

To send tokens using ChewySwap:

* **Navigate to the Send Tab:** At the top of the exchange interface, users can switch from **Swap** to **Send**. The Send tab is dedicated to one thing – helping users transfer tokens to another wallet easily. It has a very straightforward layout with fields to fill out the details of the transfer.
* **Select the Token and Amount:** The first field lets the user choose which token to send. Just like in the swap interface, tapping the token name opens the list of available tokens. The user picks the token they want to transfer (e.g., BONE, CHEWY, or any supported token in their wallet). Next, they enter the **amount** of that token to send. An estimate of the USD value may be shown here as well (giving a sense of how much value is being transferred). For example, the user might select BONE and enter “100” as the amount, seeing “$25.48” as an approximate value below it, as shown in the screenshot above.
* **Enter the Recipient’s Address or .SHIB Name:** ChewySwap supports the Shibarium Name Service (addresses that end in `.shib`), making it **easier to send to human-readable names**. In the recipient field, users can either paste the long wallet address (a 0x... Ethereum-like address) or simply type a **.shib name** if the recipient has one. For instance, instead of `0x371f...BAA0`, one could just enter `chewydoggo.shib` – which is much easier to remember. The ChewySwap interface will automatically **resolve the .shib name to the correct address** (and usually display the shortened address as confirmation, like showing 0x371f...BAA0 once resolved). This way, users can be confident they got the name right and it points to the intended wallet. This feature helps avoid the common error of copying a wrong address or sending to the wrong person, as long as the .shib name is correct.
* **Send and Confirm:** Once the token, amount, and recipient are filled in, the user clicks the **Send button**. A confirmation prompt will appear, similar to sending a transaction from a wallet. The user should **double-check** two critical things: the **amount** (is it 100 BONE or the intended amount?) and the **recipient** (is the address or name exactly correct?). Crypto transactions are **irreversible** – if you send to the wrong address, there’s no getting it back. ChewySwap’s UI provides that final confirmation step for safety. After verifying everything, the user confirms the transaction in their wallet. The transfer will then be broadcast to the network. In a moment, the recipient address will receive the tokens. There is **no special fee** charged by ChewySwap for sending tokens; unlike swaps, the aggregator doesn’t take a cut for simple transfers. The user only pays the normal blockchain **network gas fee** for the transaction (since moving tokens on-chain always costs a bit of gas).

Sending tokens via ChewySwap is as friendly as sending a photo via chat – the interface doesn’t overwhelm the user with technicalities. It even incorporates the meme-friendly Shib naming system to make the experience less “crypto geek” and more **approachable for everyone**. Whether sending a few tokens to a friend (perhaps repaying a lunch in BONE tokens for fun!), or moving assets around, the Send feature streamlines the process with a **clean, simple form** and helpful name resolution. Just remember: always check twice before hitting send, just like making sure you’re texting the right person – because in crypto, there’s no undo button!

### Market Ticker

The ChewySwap DEX aggregator page isn’t just a swap tool – it also keeps users informed with a handy **market ticker** running along the interface. This ticker is essentially a scrolling (or updating) list of select token prices and their 24-hour change, giving a quick pulse of the market at a glance. It often displays popular tokens (like major Shibarium ecosystem coins and other trending assets) with their current price in USD (or the chain’s native token) and a small indicator of how much the price has moved in the last day (e.g., +5% or -3%). The presentation might use color cues – green for price up, red for price down – to make it easy to scan.

What’s neat about the ticker is that it’s **interactive**. If a user **clicks on a token** shown in the ticker, ChewySwap will open a **popup window or modal** with more detailed information. In that token detail popup, users can typically find:

* **Market Statistics:** Key data like the token’s current price, 24h high and low, trading volume, market capitalization (if available), and other useful stats.
* **Price Chart:** Often a small chart (perhaps powered by an integration like DexScreener or TradingView) that shows the token’s price over a timeframe (like the past day or week). This helps users see trends (did the price spike recently? is it relatively stable?).
* **Project Links:** ChewySwap makes it convenient to get more information about the token by providing direct links. These can include the **official website of the project**, and social media or community links like **Twitter/X, Telegram, or Discord**, and possibly a link to the token’s page on a block explorer or CoinGecko. This way, users can DYOR (do your own research) if a token catches their eye – all without leaving the ChewySwap page.
* **Quick Actions:** In some cases, the popup might also offer a shortcut to trade that token (like a “Trade” or “Swap” button taking the user back to the swap interface with that token pre-selected), or to add the token to their wallet.

The market ticker feature turns the aggregator page into a mini dashboard for crypto market watching. New users will appreciate that they can monitor prices of top tokens in real-time while deciding on a swap. For example, a user might notice on the ticker that Token X is up 20% today – maybe prompting them to click it and learn more, or swap into it if they feel confident. It’s a bit of **meme culture meets practicality**: imagine a user seeing DOGE or SHIB coin zooming on the ticker – the interface almost winks and says “hey, look at this pup coin running today!” but in a very factual, data-driven way.

Overall, the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator page is **friendly and welcoming to new crypto users**. It provides powerful tools (like multi-DEX trading and name service transfers) in a simplified package. The tone of the platform (and this documentation) is lighthearted – you might even catch a dog meme reference or two – because crypto is meant to be fun as well as empowering. ChewySwap wants users to feel comfortable, whether they’re **seasoned traders sniffing out arbitrage** or **complete beginners taking their first steps** into decentralized finance.
