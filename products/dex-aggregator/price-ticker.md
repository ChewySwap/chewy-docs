# Price Ticker

The ChewySwap DEX aggregator page isn‚Äôt just a swap tool ‚Äì it also keeps users informed with a handy **market ticker** running along the interface. This ticker is essentially a scrolling (or updating) list of select token prices and their 24-hour change, giving a quick pulse of the market at a glance. It often displays popular tokens (like major Shibarium ecosystem coins and other trending assets) with their current price in USD (or the chain‚Äôs native token) and a small indicator of how much the price has moved in the last day (e.g., +5% or -3%). The presentation might use color cues ‚Äì green for price up, red for price down ‚Äì to make it easy to scan.

What‚Äôs neat about the ticker is that it‚Äôs **interactive**. If a user **clicks on a token** shown in the ticker, ChewySwap will open a **popup window or modal** with more detailed information. In that token detail popup, users can typically find:

* **Market Statistics:** Key data like the token‚Äôs current price, 24h high and low, trading volume, market capitalization (if available), and other useful stats.
* **Price Chart:** Often a small chart (perhaps powered by an integration like DexScreener or TradingView) that shows the token‚Äôs price over a timeframe (like the past day or week). This helps users see trends (did the price spike recently? is it relatively stable?).
* **Project Links:** ChewySwap makes it convenient to get more information about the token by providing direct links. These can include the **official website of the project**, and social media or community links like **Twitter/X, Telegram, or Discord**, and possibly a link to the token‚Äôs page on a block explorer or CoinGecko. This way, users can DYOR (do your own research) if a token catches their eye ‚Äì all without leaving the ChewySwap page.
* **Quick Actions:** In some cases, the popup might also offer a shortcut to trade that token (like a ‚ÄúTrade‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù button taking the user back to the swap interface with that token pre-selected), or to add the token to their wallet.

The market ticker feature turns the aggregator page into a mini dashboard for crypto market watching. New users will appreciate that they can monitor prices of top tokens in real-time while deciding on a swap. For example, a user might notice on the ticker that Token X is up 20% today ‚Äì maybe prompting them to click it and learn more, or swap into it if they feel confident. It‚Äôs a bit of **meme culture meets practicality**: imagine a user seeing DOGE or SHIB coin zooming on the ticker ‚Äì the interface almost winks and says ‚Äúhey, look at this pup coin running today!‚Äù but in a very factual, data-driven way.

Overall, the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator page is **friendly and welcoming to new crypto users**. It provides powerful tools (like multi-DEX trading and name service transfers) in a simplified package. The tone of the platform (and this documentation) is lighthearted ‚Äì you might even catch a dog meme reference or two ‚Äì because crypto is meant to be fun as well as empowering. ChewySwap wants users to feel comfortable, whether they‚Äôre **seasoned traders sniffing out arbitrage** or **complete beginners taking their first steps** into decentralized finance. With its easy interface, helpful visuals, and a dash of humor, the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator is like a loyal pup by the user‚Äôs side in the vast dog park of DeFi, making the adventure easier and more enjoyable. Happy swapping, and may your trades always find the best route (with maybe a few treats along the way)! üêïüöÄ
