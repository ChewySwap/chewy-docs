### How to Use the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator

Using the ChewySwap DEX Aggregator is straightforward and beginner-friendly. The interface is designed to walk users through a token swap step by step in a single screen. Here‚Äôs how a user can swap tokens on ChewySwap:

1. **Select the Tokens to Swap:** On the aggregator page, there are two main fields ‚Äì the **‚ÄúSell‚Äù box and the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù box**. In the Sell box, the user taps the token name (on the right side of the field) to choose which token they want to swap _out_. For example, if the user has Token A and wants to trade it, they would select Token A in the Sell box. In the Buy box, the user similarly taps the token name to select the token they want to receive (Token B, for instance). The interface provides a searchable list of tokens for convenience, so users can easily find the token by symbol or name.
2. **Enter the Amount to Swap:** Once the tokens are selected, the user enters the amount of the Sell token they want to swap. As soon as they type in an amount, ChewySwap will display the **estimated USD value** of that amount directly below or within the Sell box. This real-time market data helps users instantly gauge how much their input is worth in dollars, giving context especially for those more familiar with fiat values. For instance, if a user enters 100 Token A and it shows \~$50 USD, they understand the scale of their trade.
3. **Review the Expected Output:** After entering the sell amount, the Buy box will show how much of the desired token the user is expected to receive. This includes the **amount of the Buy token** and also an estimated USD value for that output. For example, it might display that 100 Token A could yield 250 Token B (‚âà$49 USD). This side-by-side display of input vs output values lets users quickly compare the two.
4. **Check Price Impact & Split Large Trades if Needed:** It‚Äôs important for users to **compare the USD value of what they‚Äôre putting in versus what they‚Äôre getting out**. In a perfect liquid market, $50 in might equal about $50 out (minus small fees). If the USD values are wildly different ‚Äì say $50 in but only $40 out ‚Äì that indicates a **large price impact or low liquidity** for that trade. ChewySwap will usually also warn of a high price impact if that‚Äôs the case. In such situations, it might be a good idea to **split the trade into smaller chunks**. By doing multiple smaller swaps, users can sometimes get a better overall rate with less slippage, especially on volatile or low-liquidity tokens. In short, **if the numbers look ‚Äúoff,‚Äù pause and adjust** before hitting swap.
5. **Token Approval (if Required):** When the user is trading a token that is **not the native coin of the chain**, an extra step is needed the first time. For example, on Shibarium, BONE is the native token used for gas, whereas an ERC-20 token like LEASH would require approval. ChewySwap will automatically detect if an approval is required. Users will see a button (usually ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù) instead of the final ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù at first. **Approving** lets the smart contract move the specified token on the user‚Äôs behalf. This is a one-time on-chain transaction per token, per app, and incurs a small gas fee. After tapping approve and confirming that transaction in their wallet, the user can then proceed to execute the swap in the second step. _(In summary, some swaps are a 2-step process: first approve the token, then execute the swap. Native tokens like BONE or DOGE don‚Äôt need approval.)_
6.  **Review the Swap Path:** Just below the Swap button, the ChewySwap interface shows a **swap path (route)** for the trade. This is a small but super-useful detail provided by the aggregator. It typically displays a series of token icons or symbols connected by arrows, along with the names of the DEXs involved in each step. For example, it might show something like Token A ‚Üí Token X ‚Üí Token B, with labels of which DEX each leg of the trade uses. This means the aggregator found it best to swap Token A to Token X on, say, Uniswap, then Token X to Token B on ChewySwap‚Äôs own pools (just as an example). By looking at this route preview, users can understand **how the trade will be executed behind the scenes**. It‚Äôs transparent ‚Äì if ChewySwap is going through multiple hops or other exchanges to get the best deal, the user sees that route clearly. For curious users, it‚Äôs almost like watching your **crypto trade GPS** find the optimal path. If the path seems too convoluted or includes an unfamiliar token as an intermediary, that‚Äôs usually nothing to worry about (the contract will handle it atomically); it‚Äôs just the aggregator being efficient.&#x20;

7. **Be Aware of the Fees (and Discounts):** ChewySwap‚Äôs aggregator applies a **0.15% swap fee** on trades. This fee is taken from the output token, similar to how many DEXs have a small fee per swap. However, there‚Äôs a special **discount program** for ChewySwap‚Äôs community: users who hold **6900 CHEWY tokens or more** (ChewySwap‚Äôs own token) get **the 0.15% fee waived entirely**. In other words, loyal Chewy holders at that threshold trade fee-free on the aggregator. Even holding fewer CHEWY tokens grants a partial discount ‚Äì it scales with the amount of CHEWY held. For example, holding **3450 CHEWY (which is 50% of 6900)** would grant a 50% fee reduction, so the user would pay only a 0.075% fee instead of 0.15%. This encourages community members to hold CHEWY for perks, and it gives a nice benefit to those already invested in the ecosystem. The interface will usually indicate if a fee is being applied or if it‚Äôs waived, so users can know if their trade will incur the aggregator fee. _(Note: This aggregator fee is separate from the usual ‚Äúliquidity provider‚Äù fees that come from the DEX pools themselves ‚Äì those are typically built into the quoted price. The 0.15% is ChewySwap‚Äôs platform fee.)_
8. **Execute the Swap:** After reviewing all the above ‚Äì the tokens, amounts, USD estimates, price impact, route, and fee ‚Äì the user is ready to **swap**. Hitting the **Swap button** will prompt a confirmation showing a summary (usually the minimum amount out, the route, and the fee, plus gas cost). The user confirms the transaction in their wallet (e.g., MetaMask or WalletConnect popup). The ChewySwap aggregator‚Äôs smart contract will then carry out the trade across the necessary DEX(s) as shown in the route. In a few moments, the user will have the new tokens in their wallet. **Voil√†!** The aggregator has seamlessly gotten them the best deal available.

Throughout this process, ChewySwap keeps the tone light and the UI intuitive ‚Äì even a first-timer can follow along. Tips or warnings (like high slippage alerts) are presented in plain language. It‚Äôs almost as if the app is a friendly guide, not just a tool. **Beginner users** don‚Äôt need to know the complex algorithms at work; they can trust that ChewySwap‚Äôs DEX aggregator is working in their favor, much like a _helpful pupper fetching the stick you threw ‚Äì but here the ‚Äústick‚Äù is the best price for your crypto trade!_ üêï
