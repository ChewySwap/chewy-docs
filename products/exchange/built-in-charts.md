Toggling the chart on Desktop will show the Chart on the left side of the swap dialog, whereas on Mobile it will show the chart taking up half the screen. To exit out of chart view on Mobile press the X or tap outside the chart area.\

Once the chart is turned on there are several controls for changing the display of the currently shown chart as highlighted below:

There are multiple different Chart Providers available depending on chain, with 3 available on Shibarium and 2 on Dogechain. Tapping the First button on the left will cycle through Dexscreener, GeckoTerminal and Web3Shards (Shibarium). The second button from the left will toggle which token price is viewed (Input or Output if not BONE). The third button from the left toggles the view of Buys and Sells on the Chart.\

Whenever a setting is changed it will be remembered for the next time you open ChewySwap for your convenience.&#x20;
