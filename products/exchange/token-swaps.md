When you make a token swap (trade) on ChewySwap Exchange, you will pay a standard fixed 0.3% trading fee that goes back to Liquidity Providers. ChewySwap dynamically checks for the best route for your trade that will yield you the best price based on your input and output token. You may check the route details as it dynamically updates underneath the Swap button.
