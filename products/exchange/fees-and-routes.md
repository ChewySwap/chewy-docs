# ðŸ—º Fees and Routes

All applicable Liquidity Provider fees show underneath the swap button dynamically as you enter the number of input and output tokens to swap. When there either isn't a direct liquidity pair to swap between for the input and output token or if there's a better deal by using a different **Route** the path taken will appear underneath the Swap button.

The swap will always show the Route that gives the best deal for the most output tokens possible taking Price Impact into consideration. This is called a Multi-Hop swap.
