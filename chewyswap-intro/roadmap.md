# ðŸ—º Roadmap

### a Roadmap is not a To-Do List!

The crypto world is fast-changing and we've got to move in step with it! Therefore this roadmap is subject to change at any time.

In other words we won't publicly commit to exact timelines. This allows us to prioritize our development based on market conditions and developer resources.
