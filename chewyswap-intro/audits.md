# üîç Audits

## ChewySwap is for Safety!

At ChewySwap the safety of our users is a top priority! Even though _**we**_ know we're safe, it's good to know that our smart contracts have no major issues that could be exploited by malicious hackers. By following the links to the Audit Summaries you can find a breakdown of the audit results which includes indicators such as whether there are Contract Fees, Max TX amounts, Pause functions, Major vulnerabilities, etc.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always stick with decentralized exchanges like us who put forth the effort to be audited by a trusted 3rd party so you know that there are no major vulnerabilities or hidden functions! Some exchanges may even have pause functions or functions that allow an authorized individual to remove funds from staking pools, which we've unfortunately seen a couple times on new exchanges recently.
